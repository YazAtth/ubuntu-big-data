    "Hadoop is an open-source framework that allows for the distributed storage and processing of Big Data! It works in three modes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Standalone\n",
    "2. Pseudo-distributed\n",
    "3. Fully-distributed\n",
    "\n",
    "To save us a bit of time with setup and system wiring, we'll use the pseudo-distributed mode in this lab. Each of the daemons responsible for distributed storage and processing will run as separate processes on a single host, localhost.\n",
    "\n",
    "Main deamons:\n",
    "* NameNode\n",
    "* Resource Manager\n",
    "* Standby NameNode\n",
    "\n",
    "Worker deamons:\n",
    "* DataNode\n",
    "* Node Manager\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll still need to do a little bit of configuration, but this should be a nice solution using just our one machine! If you'd like a more verbose version of this process and/or a breakdown of the standalone mode, [this source](https://github.com/LMAPcoder/Hadoop-on-Colab) provides a nicely detailed tutorial."
